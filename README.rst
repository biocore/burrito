The pre-history of burrito
--------------------------

burrito is derived from the `application controller framework <http://pycogent.org/examples/application_controller_framework.html>`__
code, which was originally added to `PyCogent <http://www.pycogent.org>`__ and
later moved to `scikit-bio <http://scikit-bio.org>`__. The contributors and/or
copyright holders have agreed to make the code they wrote for PyCogent
available under the BSD license. The original authors of the application
controller framework code in PyCogent are Greg Caporaso
(`@gregcaporaso <https://github.com/gregcaporaso>`__), Sandra Smit,
Micah Hamady, and Rob Knight (`@rob-knight <https://github.com/rob-knight>`__).
