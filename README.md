The pre-history of burrito
--------------------------

burrito is derived from the [*application controller framework*](http://pycogent.org/examples/application_controller_framework.html)
code, which was originally added to [PyCogent](http://www.pycogent.org) and
later moved to [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org). The contributors and/or
copyright holders have agreed to make the code they wrote for PyCogent
available under the BSD license. The original authors of the *application
controller framework* code in PyCogent are Greg Caporaso
([@gregcaporaso](https://github.com/gregcaporaso]), Sandra Smit, Micah Hamady,
and Rob Knight ([@rob-knight](https://github.com/rob-knight)).
